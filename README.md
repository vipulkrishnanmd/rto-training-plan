# rto-training-plan
This is a small application made for creating training plans for an RTO.

RTO's usually run short term courses where students can enrol throughout the year.

Trainers go through the course units as a cycle continuously and students start with the units which are currently being taught. So, every student has a customised training plan based on the time they join.

This application helps to generate the customised training plan from a common template.
